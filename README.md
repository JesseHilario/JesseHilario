- I created a custom database hosted on Supabase by first mapping user requirements in an ERD
- Used stored procedures to make transactions to allow consistency instead of having frontend handle them

* You are trying to decide where in the US to reside. The most important factor to you is temperature, you hate cold weather.
* In [part one](https://github.com/JesseHilario/JesseHilario.github.io/blob/main/SQL/2023_finding_a_home_project/Submission%201%20-%20SQL%20Questions.sql), I created a view with schemabinding (tsql) with only relevant columns and US locations. Created an index for speed and used windowing to find 4-day moving average for days of the year
* In [part two](https://github.com/JesseHilario/JesseHilario.github.io/blob/main/SQL/2023_finding_a_home_project/Submission%202%20-%20Geospatial%20Data%20and%20Stored%20Procedure.sql), I created a stored procedure that calculated distance in meters and hours of travel for each city in a given state, based on starting coordinates
* In addition to the temperature, you are also very concerned with crime in the area. In [part 3](https://github.com/JesseHilario/JesseHilario.github.io/blob/main/SQL/2023_finding_a_home_project/Submission%203%20-%20Crime%20Data.sql), I updated the stored procedure to output the yearly number of gun crimes committed within 10 miles of each city. I then ranked the cities of New Jersey, with Newark having the most gun crimes within a 10-mile radius


#### [Exploring Baseball Player and Team Data](https://github.com/JesseHilario/JesseHilario.github.io/tree/main/SQL/2023_Baseball_database_SQL)
