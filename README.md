Hello there and welcome to my github ðŸ‘‹ 

***
## Mission
My name is Jesse Hilario and I have recently completed the Google Data Analytics Cerfitication on Coursera. This certificate has prepared me for a career in data analysis by training me in the data analysis process (ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, act) by learning to use the tools listed below. I chose to use R for my capstone and am currently working on more projects to hone my knowledge of SQL and Python.

I have a strong background in social science research with two years of experience working as a research assistant in undergraduate. I am looking to apply my skills and interest in statistics and data visualization in domains outside of academia and research.

I have a passion for psychology and sports--I would love to work on a project with you in those areas! On this page you can find my projects along with links and summary statements.
