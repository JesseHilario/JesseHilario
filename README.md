Hello there and welcome to my github ðŸ‘‹ 

***
## Mission
My name is Jesse Hilario and I am a current student at NJIT taking the Data Mining graduate certificate at NJIT. This, coupled with my previous experience earning my Google certification and self-study, has prepared me for a career in data analysis by training me in asking questions suitable for the business task, effective visualization, machine learning fundamentals, Agile methodologies and Lean principles, and in the overall data analysis process (ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, act) using the tools listed below.

I have a strong background in social science research with two years of experience working as a research assistant in undergraduate. I am looking to apply my skills and interest in statistics and data visualization in domains outside of academia and research.

I have a passion for psychology and sports--I would love to work on a project with you in those areas! On this page you can find links to my portfolio as well as a summary of my skills and current endeavours.
