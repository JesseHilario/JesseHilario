Hello there and welcome to my github ðŸ‘‹ 

***
## Mission
My name is Jesse Hilario and I am a current student taking the Data Mining graduate certificate at NJIT. This coursework, coupled with self-study and my previous experience earning my Google certification, has prepared me for a career in data analysis by training me in asking questions suitable for the business task, effective visualization, machine learning fundamentals, Agile methodologies and Lean principles, and in the overall data analysis process (ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, act) using the tools listed below.

I have a strong background in social science research with two years of experience working as a research assistant in undergraduate. I am looking to apply my skills and interest in statistics and data visualization in domains outside of academia and research.

I have a passion for psychology and sports--I would love to work on a project with you in those areas! On this page you can find links to my portfolio as well as a summary of my skills and current endeavours.

- Kaggle Machine Learning competition, accounted for attributes to predict whether a passenger survives the titanic
- Preprocessing: used sklearn for feature engineering (using domain knowledge), EDA, missing value imputation, data transformation
- Model Tuning: input preprocessing steps and random forest model into a pipeline to be optimized & cross-validated using gridsearchcv


* Currently working on implementing from scratch and comparing Apriori Algorithm vs brute force in a transactional database with Python

* You are trying to decide where in the US to reside. The most important factor to you is temperature, you hate cold weather.
* In [part one](https://github.com/JesseHilario/JesseHilario.github.io/blob/main/SQL/2023_finding_a_home_project/Submission%201%20-%20SQL%20Questions.sql), I created a view with schemabinding (tsql) with only relevant columns and US locations. Created an index for speed and used windowing to find 4-day moving average for days of the year
* In [part two](https://github.com/JesseHilario/JesseHilario.github.io/blob/main/SQL/2023_finding_a_home_project/Submission%202%20-%20Geospatial%20Data%20and%20Stored%20Procedure.sql), I created a stored procedure that calculated distance in meters and hours of travel for each city in a given state, based on starting coordinates
* In addition to the temperature, you are also very concerned with crime in the area. In [part 3](https://github.com/JesseHilario/JesseHilario.github.io/blob/main/SQL/2023_finding_a_home_project/Submission%203%20-%20Crime%20Data.sql), I updated the stored procedure to output the yearly number of gun crimes committed within 10 miles of each city. I then ranked the cities of New Jersey, with Newark having the most gun crimes within a 10-mile radius


#### [Exploring Baseball Player and Team Data](https://github.com/JesseHilario/JesseHilario.github.io/tree/main/SQL/2023_Baseball_database_SQL)
